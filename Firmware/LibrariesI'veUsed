This is the library for the CO²-sensor: https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-scd-40-and-scd-41/arduino

Here is the documentation for RemoteXY: https://remotexy.com/en/help/

Because RemoteXY uses bluetooth you have to also use the BLEDevice library for arduino ide: https://github.com/nkolban/ESP32_BLE_Arduino/tree/master

And since the sensor is an I2C device you also must use the wire library: https://docs.arduino.cc/language-reference/en/functions/communication/wire/
